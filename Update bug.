Upgrade serialize-javascript to version 3.1.0 or later. For example:

"dependencies": {
  "serialize-javascript": ">=3.1.0"
}
orâ€¦
"devDependencies": {
  "serialize-javascript": ">=3.1.0"
}
Always verify the validity and compatibility of suggestions with your codebase.

Details
CVE-2020-7660
high severity
Vulnerable versions: < 3.1.0
Patched version: 3.1.0
serialize-javascript prior to 3.1.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code via the function "deleteFunctions" within "index.js".

An object such as {"foo": /1"/, "bar": "a\"@__R-<UID>-0__@"} was serialized as {"foo": /1"/, "bar": "a\/1"/}, which allows an attacker to escape the bar key. This requires the attacker to control the values of both foo and bar and guess the value of <UID>. The UID has a keyspace of approximately 4 billion making it a realistic network attack.

The following proof-of-concept calls console.log() when the running eval():
eval('('+ serialize({"foo": /1" + console.log(1)/i, "bar": '"@__R-<UID>-0__@'}) + ')');
